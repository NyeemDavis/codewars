// Path Finder #1: can you reach the exit?
// Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5765870e190b1472ec0022a2
// Problem 
    // You are at position [0, 0] in maze NxN and you can only move in one of the four cardinal directions
    // ("N","S","E","W"), you can't move diagonally or outside of the maze.
    // Return true if you can reach position [N-1, N-1] or false otherwise.
// Notes
    // Empty positions are marked .
    // Walls are marked W.
    // Start and exit positions are empty in all test cases.
// Examples
  

// Psuedo Code
// Not worried about the shortest path
// Checking if there is an empty space, wall or already moved to position
